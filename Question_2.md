# Android Login UI

Write an Android code that creates a **login UI** with two edit text fields. 

The first edit text field is for the **username**, while the second one is for the **password**. 

Upon pressing the login button, the code should validate the inputs, and if the validation passes, 

it should show a **toast** message indicating **successful login**. However, 

if the validation fails, the code should show a **toast message** stating the **errors**.
